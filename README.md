Welcome to the new document repository for the 2025 CyberForce Competition

This will be where the MOST up to date items will be kept for the competition. Some folders will be empty until you have access to the infrastructure.

Infrastructure access will be provided on November 3, 2025. You will receive AWS Credentials as well as instructions on how to connect.

The week of October 27, you should be actively working on your C-Suite video. Good luck.
